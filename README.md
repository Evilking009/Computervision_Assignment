Hello sir. The Following code is inside the folder named as "Assignment".


Below are the screenshots of the Computer image processing program.


# Report

In this program, in order to achieve greyed-out blurry background & Sharpening Effect along with improved image quality on any portrait image. I’ve used various python image processing libraries like Pixellib, OpenCV, and Numpy. First, by using Pixellib. I’ve used pre-defined model and with the help of this model we were able to have grey background on image as well as blurred background. Second, in order to improve the image quality and do operations on matrices, I’ve used the Numpy Library and its methods. I’ve used 2 convolution matrices and with the help of convolution between kernel and a given image, therefore the sharpness of photo is increased as well as the exposure of the photo. Furthermore, I’ve controlled the over-sharpness and low resolution of photo by using some methods provided by OpenCV are blur and detailEnhance method. Further 

improvements I’ve done is applying Adaptive histogram on images which improves the contrast and sharpness. Last but not least, that I’ve applied the filter called bilateral filter which smoothen the image at the cost of cartoonish effect on image. To finalize this report to an end, OpenCV library is used to read images. First, I’ve used imread method to read both images. Second, in order to display images in a respective size, I’ve used a unique syntax to display images with respect to given percentage defined by integer variable. The resize and imshow method is used. By using OpenCV library, we have successfully displayed both images of before and after the processing in form of horizontal stack method provided by Numpy library. Basically this program improves the blurs image along with grey background and enhances the quality of photo.
